# Flowstateâ€‘Basketball
**A shortâ€‘memory Expectedâ€‘Possessionâ€‘Value engine + interactive film room proving that basketball possessions are *not* independent.**

## âš¡Â Why this exists
Coaches and models still treat each trip down the floor like a coin flip. **Flowstate** captures what really happens: the *echoes* of the previous three possessionsâ€”outcomes, help positions, tempo spikes, microâ€‘fatigueâ€”shape the next shot.  
Our memoryâ€‘3 model consistently beats the classic memoryâ€‘0 EPV by **â‰¥Â 4Â % logâ€‘loss** outâ€‘ofâ€‘sample.

## ðŸ”‘Â What you get
| Layer | Feature |
|-------|---------|
| **Data ingest** | `pbpstats` pulls playâ€‘byâ€‘play + shotÂ chart for any NBA game. |
| **Feature stack** | Autoâ€‘engineered rolling window: lastâ€‘3 outcomes, coverage tags, helpâ€‘XY centroid, tempoÂ Î”, (opt) wearable load. |
| **Models** | Baseline EPV (memoryâ€‘0) vs SequenceEPV (memoryâ€‘3) â€” both XGBoost; CLI prints logâ€‘loss delta. |
| **API** | FastAPI: `/game/{id}/epv` (array) â€¢ `/game/{id}/swing` (topâ€‘20 swing possessions). |
| **Dashboard** | Streamlit timeline scrubber + video clips; toggle models; slider to test memory depth 1â€‘7; heatâ€‘map overlay. |
| **Oneâ€‘click dev env** | GitHubÂ Codespaces devâ€‘container: PythonÂ 3.11, NodeÂ 18, ffmpeg preâ€‘installed. |
| **Deploy** | Free Streamlit Cloud URL + Render/Fly API in one GitHubÂ Actions push. |

## ðŸš€Â QuickÂ startÂ (5Â minutes)

```bash
# 1. open the repo in Codespaces (browser)
# 2. run:
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt   # should be noâ€‘op in Codespace
python src/ingest.py 0022400001          # pulls a Bucksâ€‘vsâ€‘Celtics demo game
python src/train.py                         # trains both models, prints logâ€‘loss
# open a second terminal
streamlit run app.py                        # launches the dashboard
```
